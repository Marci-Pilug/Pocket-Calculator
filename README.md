# Pocket-Calculator
This project implements a simple pocket calculator capable of performing the four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is designed to work with 8-bit signed operands and is implemented on an FPGA board, using 7-segment displays to show the results.
